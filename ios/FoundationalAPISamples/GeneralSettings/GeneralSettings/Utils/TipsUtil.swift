let expectedCountExplain = "The fewer expected barcode count, the higher barcode decoding speed. When the expected count is set to 0, the barcode reader will try to decode at least one barcode."

let resultVerificationExplain = "Improve the accuracy at the expense of a bit speed."

let duplicateFilterExplain = "Filter out the duplicate barcode results over a period of time."

let duplicateForgetTimeExplain = "Set the time period of result deduplication. Measured by millisecond."
